This project is intended to allow for java-only development of tree kernel
algorithms in a support vector machine framework. The project is a fork of the 
libsvm-java-kernel project on Github by Syeed Ibn Faiz. That project is in turn
a fork of libsvm. 

My thanks go to Syeed who did most of the initial work of making libsvm 
compatible with generic instance types, which made tree kernel work possible. 
And of course the java-based version of libsvm is a great resource. My purpose 
in forking this project is to create a new version which can be submitted to
Maven central for ease of inclusion by other open source projects. To that end 
I have maven-ized the layout, as well as making some minor architectural 
changes and removing classes that aren't strictly necessary to the purposes
needed for my own research.

Any contributions to this project would be welcomed.
